* Open Test Robot Platform - The Architecture

Open Test Robot Platform complies with the following component based
architecture. 

#+CAPTION: Open Test Robot Platform components and their relations
[[./components.png]]

** Core components defined by the platform

*** User interaction module

*** Gesture module

*** Observation module

    (Name suggestions: Perception module, Observation module)

*** Image capture module

*** Robot control module

In most cases, this module is not a separate component but merged into Gesture
module, because there are too much variation and no generally accepted robot
control semantics. For example, some robot manufactures have implemented
some gestures in firmware.

Platform provides a simple mock robot interface for testing purposes and as
an example for DIY robot makers. The module have following methods:
- (get) current position in robot coordinates
- (init) move robot to initial position
- (move) absolute and relative movement
- (execute) timed complex movement along a path defined by a position
  sequence.

*** System and coordinate handling configuration

This component manages information which is collected during system setup
and used by the platform components.  It contains at least
- modules for the roles of the architecture
- robot coordinates for the reference points of the device under test
  + top left corner of the display
  + top right corner of the display
  + bottom left corner of the display
  + bottom right corner of the display (This is used to estimate the
    accuracy of the setup data.)
- additional named locations (power switch for example)
- functions for coordinate transformations
- safe operation and free movement regions inside robot working space

** Third party components

These are not part of the platform itself but they provide functionality
which is mandatory for a fully functional system.

*** Icon recognition

*** Text recognition

*** Device screenshot API

*** Device control API

*** Camera

*** Robot

** Associated components

Associated components are not part of the platform, meaning that their
interfaces and implementation are left open. However, they are still
necessary for the use of the platform in automated testing, either
controlling core modules or being controlled by them.

*** Test automation

Test automation is the component that controls the test run, whether a
script, model-based test generator or something else. The tester may fill
this slot by whatever test automation they are already using.

The module sends high-level commands as inputs to the user interaction API
and receives processed outputs in return. It may also make use of the
environmental control \& measurement module(s) as needed.

*** SUT

The system under test (SUT) is whatever is to be tested or otherwise
controlled. It is controlled by the robot and its state can be examined by a
camera or instrumentation.

** External components

The large test automation system may include external components, but the
platform is functional without them. For example, the environmental control
& measurement component (or a collection of such components) can be used to
control the test environment and thereby indirectly affect the SUT, as well
as collect various data about the SUT and environment. In practice, it may
have an architecture similar to the robot/camera structure of the
architecture. While some features belonging to the purview of this component
are often needed in testing, the exact requirements vary so much that there
is no sense in providing a fixed interface, architecture or implementation.
